# Visual types — controlled vocabulary

Single source of truth for visual placement decisions across the pipeline. Every visual planned in an outline must use one of the `type` values below. The pipeline reads the type to decide how to capture or generate the asset.

## The 9 types

| Type | When to use | Capture strategy |
|---|---|---|
| `screenshot` | Section walks through a brand-owned product UI at a **static, navigable URL**. The page renders the wanted state immediately on load (or after a known modal dismissal). No multi-step interaction required. | Patchright headless capture (Playwright fork with CF/bot bypass). May require auth (`setup_auth.py`). |
| `action-shot` | Section needs the UI in a state that **only exists after a sequence of actions** — clicking through a wizard, sending a message in a conversation, opening settings, dismissing a non-trivial modal, mid-form state. Also the right tool when `screenshot` can't get past the site's bot protection. | Default: routed to `manual-capture.md` for the editor to handle interactively via `/capture-visuals` (driven by Claude in Chrome — full visibility and control, no token cost, uses the editor's real Chrome session). Opt-in agent fallback: set `BROWSER_USE_ENABLED=1` to delegate to Browser Use Cloud (~$0.05–$0.15/visual). |
| `image` | Section either (a) **explains a concept, mental model, workflow, or relationship** that a labeled diagram would convey faster than prose (highest-value `image` use — `sub=concept-illustration` or `sub=diagram`), or (b) needs an aesthetic / scene-setting illustration where the prose alone leaves the reader without a visual anchor (`sub=lifestyle`, rare). **SFW only.** | AI-generated via Replicate. Default model `openai/gpt-image-2`, backup `google/nano-banana`. Prompts must be specific, structured, and label-explicit — vague prompts produce vague art. |
| `table` | Section compares N items across M dimensions, or presents structured comparison data. | Inline markdown table — no asset file. The draft writes the table directly. |
| `chart` | Section presents quantitative data with trends, distributions, or proportions (search volumes, percentages, rankings). | matplotlib PNG rendered from data in the research dossier. |
| `video` | Section references an embedded video (YouTube, Loom, screen recording, demo). | Editor-managed: provide an embed URL; rendered as `<iframe>` or Strapi video block. Not auto-captured. |
| `external` | Section references something the brand doesn't own that adds *specific* value — a Reddit comment we cite, a tweet, a chart in a news article, a competitor UI panel, a third-party tool screen. **PLEAA-417 (2026-05-06): auto-captured by default**, not routed to manual. | Patchright headless capture of the URL plus a CSS `selector` that clips to the relevant element (the comment, the tweet, the chart). `crop=padded` adds breathing room around the bbox. On Cloudflare / login-wall / nav-fail, the manifest entry stays `failed` with a `fallback.method=claude_in_chrome` breadcrumb so `/capture-visuals` retries via a real Chrome session. ToS bypasses (puzzle-solving, IP rotation chains) are out of scope: if both paths fail, the entry stays `failed` and the visuals gate halts. |
| `gif` | Section needs an animated GIF for a multi-step interaction text alone struggles to describe. | Editor-managed: provide a screen-recording source; ffmpeg conversion is a future enhancement. |
| `none` | Section is purely transitional, very short (<150 words), or argumentative-rhetorical — a forced visual would dilute it. **Use sparingly:** the new editorial bar (per `editorial-principles-visuals.md`) is that most non-trivial sections deserve a visual, often more than one. | Skip — no placeholder rendered, no asset generated. |

## Decision rule (one-pass check)

For each H2 section in an outline, ask in this order. The first "yes" wins. **Sections often warrant more than one visual** — once you find a primary, also ask whether a secondary type (e.g. `chart` after a `screenshot`, or `external` after an `image`) would carry additional concrete information.

1. Does the section walk through a **brand product UI at a static URL**, where the wanted state is visible on first load (or after one age-gate/cookie click)? → `screenshot`
2. Does the section need a UI state that **only exists after multi-step interaction** (clicks through a wizard, sending messages, opening settings, mid-form state)? → `action-shot`
3. Does the section **compare N things on M axes**? → `table`
4. Does the section present **quantitative data with trends**? → `chart`
5. Does the section **reference a third-party artifact** (a Reddit comment we quote, a tweet, a chart in a news article, a competitor UI panel)? → `external` — pair with `selector=` so we capture the exact element, not the whole page.
6. Does the section **explain a concept, mental model, workflow, or "how it works" idea** that a labeled diagram would convey faster than the next paragraph? → `image` with `sub=concept-illustration` or `sub=diagram` (gpt-image-2 with a specific structured prompt — labels, layout, components).
7. Does the section need an **animated multi-step demo**? → `gif`
8. Does the section embed a **video / demo** where motion is essential? → `video`
9. Would a **scene-setting / atmospheric illustration** add specific value, SFW? → `image` with `sub=lifestyle` (rare; high bar — must convey something prose can't).
10. Otherwise → `none` — argue with prose, not pictures

**New default bias:** the editorial bar (per `editorial-principles-visuals.md`) is that most non-trivial sections in a well-researched article have something concrete to show. If the decision tree above leaves you at "none" for a 300+ word section, double-check by asking: "is there a flow, comparison, claim, or concept here that a labeled `image` would explain better than prose?" Forced visuals are still bad — but visual under-density is now a more common failure than over-density.

## `screenshot` vs `action-shot` — the key distinction

The two are easy to confuse. Mistakes here are the most common reason a visual fails or comes back wrong.

**Choose `screenshot` when:**
- The URL renders the wanted state directly. Open URL → see the thing.
- Optional: a single age-gate or cookie banner dismissal is needed (the static dispatcher handles those automatically).
- Cost: free (runs on your VPS).

**Choose `action-shot` when:**
- The reader needs to see what it looks like *after* a click/type/wait sequence. The state isn't reachable by URL alone.
- Or: the page IS at a static URL but the site's bot protection is too aggressive for `screenshot` (Cloudflare Pro, DataDome, etc.).
- Cost: **free.** Routed to `/capture-visuals`, which drives the VPS's always-on Chrome via the Claude in Chrome MCP — uses your real Chrome session, your subscription, your IP. No token billing, no per-task fees. (Opt-in: set `BROWSER_USE_ENABLED=1` to delegate to the Browser Use Cloud agent instead at ~$0.05–$0.15/visual; rarely needed.)
- Model: always **Sonnet 4.6** (`claude-sonnet-4-6`). Browser driving is high-throughput / low-reasoning, and Opus is wasted spend here. The VPS systemd unit and cron triggers pin `--model claude-sonnet-4-6` for the same reason.

**Examples that map clearly:**

- `pleasur.ai/create` (templates grid, default state) → `screenshot`
- `pleasur.ai/create` after picking Realistic and reaching the Ethnicity step → `action-shot`
- A chat conversation in mid-flow with the typing indicator visible → `action-shot`
- A privacy settings panel with all toggles enabled → `action-shot`
- A static feature page on the marketing site → `screenshot`
- A competitor's product UI behind their bot wall → `action-shot` (when ToS allows)

## SFW / adult content rule (Pleasur.AI specific)

Replicate's `openai/gpt-image-2` and `google/nano-banana` will refuse adult prompts and may flag the API account. For visuals that depict adult content (companion characters in suggestive scenarios, etc.):

- Use `safety=adult` in the placeholder
- The pipeline routes the placeholder to `manual-capture.md` — the editor produces the image manually using the brand's own tooling at `pleasur.ai/generate`
- **Never** call Replicate with adult prompts, even if `safety` is unset and the prompt happens to imply adult content

Default for any `image` placeholder is `safety=sfw`. Most blog illustrations should be SFW (lifestyle, abstract, scene-setting, no people) — that also keeps the published article SFW for ad-network and embed compatibility.

## Placeholder syntax (for `/draft`)

The draft realizes the outline's typed `Visual:` block as a single typed placeholder per section. Format:

```
[VISUAL:type=<type>;<key>=<value>;<key>=<value>...]
```

### Examples

```
[VISUAL:type=screenshot;target=create;what=character backstory & traits panel;selector=.backstory-panel;annotate=#voice-button]

[VISUAL:type=screenshot;target=create;what=top-of-page hero with sign-up CTA;crop=0,0,1440,720]

[VISUAL:type=action-shot;url=https://pleasur.ai/create;goal=Navigate to pleasur.ai/create. Dismiss the age verification dialog. Click the Realistic template card. Wait for the Ethnicity selection step to load. Capture that screen.;what=Companion Creator Ethnicity step]

```

Tables are not placeholders — `/draft` writes them inline as markdown.

### `action-shot` placeholder fields

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `goal` | yes | Natural-language description of the full sequence: navigation + actions + what to capture. Be specific about which screen to land on. |
| `url` | recommended | Starting URL. Speeds up the agent (skips a search step). |
| `what` | yes | Short caption / alt text. Used for the published image. |
| `max_steps` | no | Override default of 25. Lower for simple tasks (saves $), higher for complex flows. |
| `llm` | no | Override default `claude-sonnet-4-6`. Try `gpt-4.1-mini` for cheaper / faster on simple tasks. |

### `image` placeholder fields

`image` covers two distinct sub-types. Choose deliberately.

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `sub` | recommended | One of `concept-illustration` (default), `diagram`, `flow-diagram`, `comparison`, `lifestyle`. Drives prompt-template defaults — the dispatcher may prepend style hints (e.g. "clean editorial illustration, white background, sans-serif labels" for diagrams). |
| `prompt` | yes | The full image prompt. **Be specific.** For diagrams: name every labeled component, describe layout (left-to-right, side-by-side, etc.), specify connectors (arrows, lines), and demand a clean editorial style. For lifestyle: describe scene, lighting, mood, "no people" (or "people, no faces shown") to avoid the AI face-rendering problem. |
| `style` | recommended | `illustration` (default for diagrams), `photorealistic` (default for lifestyle), `flat-vector`, `isometric`. |
| `safety` | recommended | `sfw` (default; pipeline calls Replicate) or `adult` (routes to manual capture; pipeline never sends adult prompts to Replicate). |

**Prompt patterns that work for `concept-illustration` / `diagram`:**

- *"Flow diagram showing X. Components from left to right: A → B → C. Each component labeled with [name]. Arrows showing direction. Clean editorial illustration, white background, sans-serif labels, brand-neutral colors."*
- *"Side-by-side comparison: '[Concept A]' on left vs '[Concept B]' on right. Each side has [shared structure] with [specific differences highlighted]. Clean editorial illustration, white background, sans-serif labels."*
- *"Layered architecture diagram. Bottom layer labeled '[base]'. Middle layer labeled '[middle]'. Top layer labeled '[top]'. Arrows show data flow upward. Clean editorial style, white background."*

**Prompt anti-patterns** (produce vague art):

- "An AI girlfriend." (no structure, no labels, no scene)
- "A futuristic concept of love and technology." (abstract, no concrete elements)
- "A diagram of how AI works." (no specifics — what diagram, what components, what relationships)

The diagram prompts that work read like a *brief to a junior illustrator*, not like a haiku.

### `external` placeholder fields (PLEAA-417)

`external` is the right type when the section *quotes* or *cites* something the brand doesn't own and the visual evidence is a specific element on that page — a single Reddit comment, a tweet, a chart inside an article, a competitor pricing tier. Always pair with `selector` to clip to the element; a viewport-sized screenshot of a Reddit thread is wasted space.

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `url` | yes | Source URL. Must be reachable without login when possible; if login-walled, the manifest entry will fall back to `/capture-visuals` (real Chrome session). |
| `selector` | strongly recommended | CSS selector clipping to the element that matters. Reddit comment IDs (`#t1_<id>`), tweet `article[data-testid="tweet"]`, news `figure.chart`, competitor `.pricing-table`. |
| `sub` | recommended | One of `reddit-comment`, `tweet`, `news-quote`, `competitor-ui`, `chart`. Free-form metadata today; future heuristics may auto-pick selectors per sub. |
| `crop` | no | `padded` (default for external, ~48px breathing room around the bbox) or `tight` (~8px). Or `X,Y,W,H` for a manual rectangle if no selector works. |
| `what` | yes | Short caption / alt text. Used for the published image. |
| `validate` | no | Set `validate=true` to add a Claude-vision sanity check (~$0.003/capture). |

**Sub-type cheatsheet:**

- `sub=reddit-comment` — `selector=#t1_<base36-comment-id>` (the data-fullname suffix on the comment node). Old Reddit (`old.reddit.com`) renders cleaner than new Reddit; prefer it when you can.
- `sub=tweet` — `selector=article[data-testid="tweet"]`. X/Twitter login-gates many pages; expect the Claude-in-Chrome fallback to handle most of these.
- `sub=news-quote` — selectors vary by publication. `figure.chart`, `.embedded-chart`, `.article__pull-quote` are common starting points; inspect the page first.
- `sub=competitor-ui` — `.pricing-table`, `.feature-grid`, etc. ToS check before scraping; if competitor blocks bots aggressively, flag and use a manual capture.
- `sub=chart` — when the source is a chart (vs the page that hosts it). Often the same selector as `news-quote` with a tighter crop.

**ToS rule:** we don't bypass site protections. If both Playwright and Claude-in-Chrome fail, the entry stays `failed` and the visuals gate halts — do not chain proxies, solve CAPTCHAs, or scrape rate-limit-protected APIs to make it pass.

## Targeting and quality (`screenshot` and `external`)

A screenshot of a whole viewport is rarely the right capture. Specify what to clip to:

| Directive | When to use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `selector=<css>` | The thing you want to show is a specific element on the page (a card, a panel, a single post, a Reddit comment, a tweet). The capture is clipped to that element's bounding box. | `selector=.companion-card[data-id="123"]` |
| `crop=padded` / `crop=tight` | With `selector`, expand the bbox by ~48px (padded) or ~8px (tight) before clipping. Padded is the right default for external visuals — bbox-tight Reddit/tweet captures look cramped. | `selector=#t1_xyz;crop=padded` |
| `crop=X,Y,W,H` | No clean selector is available, but you know the rectangle. Coordinates in CSS pixels (pre-2x scale). | `crop=0,0,1440,720` (top-of-viewport hero) |
| `annotate=<css>` | Highlight an element with a red outline before capture. Independent of selector — you can highlight one thing inside a larger element. | `annotate=#voice-button` |
| (none) | Capture the whole 1440×900 viewport. Use sparingly — usually you want a selector. | — |

### Quality validation (post-capture)

Every screenshot capture runs heuristic checks automatically:

- **Final URL didn't redirect to login** — catches expired auth
- **Image dimensions sane** — catches render failures
- **Color variance > 0.02** — catches blank / mostly-uniform captures (login walls, white screens)
- **File size > 5KB** — catches truncated writes

If a check fails → the visual is flagged in `manual-capture.md` for the editor to handle. If it's "suspect" (low color variance) → captured but flagged for review.

### Optional vision validation

Set `validate=true` on the placeholder (or `VISUAL_VALIDATION=true` env var) to additionally ask Claude (Haiku) to look at the image and verify it shows what `what=` said it would. Costs ~$0.003/check; off by default. Catches subtler failures the heuristics miss (e.g., the page rendered a different feature than expected).

```
[VISUAL:type=screenshot;target=create;what=companion creator backstory panel;selector=.create-panel;validate=true]
```

## Backwards compatibility

The pipeline still accepts the legacy `[SCREENSHOT: description]` form. `/generate-visuals` treats it as `[VISUAL:type=screenshot;what=description]`. New outlines should use the typed form.

## Quality bar per type

| Type | Minimum quality |
|---|---|
| `screenshot` | 1440×900 viewport, 2× retina (2880×1800 PNG), Pillow-optimized |
| `image` | 1024×1024 minimum (model default); upscale only if model supports it |
| `chart` | Min 1200px wide, brand-neutral palette, axis labels & title |
| `gif` / `video` | Editor-managed quality; pipeline doesn't enforce |

Every visual gets a markdown caption / alt text derived from the placeholder's `what=` or `prompt=` field. Captions are part of the publishable output, not an afterthought.
