# BID Method — Distilled Reference (Ahrefs edition)

> **2026-06-24:** This file is the Ahrefs edition. The per-tool mapping and param rules live in [`../../research/references/ahrefs-mcp-cheatsheet.md`](../../research/references/ahrefs-mcp-cheatsheet.md) — read it first; every Ahrefs tool is `mcp__ahrefs__*`, params are comma-separated **strings** (not arrays), and `select`+`country` are required. The recalibration math that used to live in a separate `*-metric-translation.md` doc is folded inline below (that doc is retired). Metrics/threshold logic here is the source of truth.

> Source: Ryan Law's keyword-research method, on Ahrefs' data surface. Codified here as the operational checklist `/keyword-vet-bid` applies. Read this when the BID gate's behavior is unclear or thresholds need tuning.

The BID method is the second-to-last layer of defense before a keyword reaches the writing pipeline. It's mechanical (heuristics + Ahrefs metrics, no judgment), cheap, and deterministic. Layer 4 (redteam) handles the judgment-heavy challenges.

## B — Business potential

> "Ask yourself: if I rank number one for this keyword, does it actually help my business achieve its goals?"

The keyword's value isn't its volume — it's the share of that volume that converts to brand outcome (revenue / users / mentions / authority). Two heuristics:

1. **brand_fit ≥ 4** — the keyword's topic must be relevant to the brand's audience, not adjacent or off-topic.
   - 10: addresses a specific stated pain point in `brand-config.md`
   - 7: relevant topic the audience cares about
   - 4: adjacent — audience might find it useful (floor)
   - 0-3: wrong audience entirely → reject

2. **product_fit ≥ 3** — the article should be writable in a way that demonstrates a brand product naturally.
   - 10: impossible to write well without mentioning a brand product
   - 7: product strongly helps demonstrate the topic
   - 3: product can be mentioned in passing (floor)
   - 0-2: no relevant product → reject (Ryan Law: 77% of his Ahrefs blog posts scored 2-3 here; 0s rarely worth writing)

   Exception: if `brand-config.md` lists no live products, set the product_fit weight to zero and skip this gate.

3. **Vanity-rank check**: the "what is espresso" example. Volume + low difficulty + irrelevant intent = traffic that doesn't move the needle. The redteam (Layer 4) is the judgment-based version of this; the mechanical version is brand_fit ≥ 4.

4. **business_value + free-seeker check (the conversion signal — the Ahrefs way, 2026-06-29).** `product_fit` (heuristic 2) already captures the real buying undercurrent — *is our product the natural answer to this topic?* — and it is HIGH for genuinely useful **informational, product-adjacent** posts (the Ahrefs model: "how to do keyword research", not "best keyword tool"). **Do NOT add a separate reward for salesy "best/review/pricing" phrasing** — that makes the blog thirsty; a comparison post already scores high via `product_fit` when it genuinely fits, and that's enough. Two outputs feed Layer 5:
   - **`business_value` 0-3** (course term) = `product_fit` gated by audience: 3 = product is the natural answer for a paying-prospect topic; 2 = helps, mentionable; 1 = weak path; 0 = no product fit → skip.
   - **`free_seeker` flag** = the keyword signals a reader who won't pay even when the product fits: "free", "no filter"/"no-filter", "unfiltered", "uncensored", "unlimited", "without paying/account/signup". This is the real leak (PostHog: these = high traffic, ~0 paid). Flag it; Layer 5 applies a penalty. Do NOT hard-reject (Ryan: a strong sales angle still converts *some* — business_value 1-2, not 0).

## I — Intent (Ahrefs classifier primary, SERP-grounded fallback)

> "No matter what you do, if you can't match the intent of the searcher, you will never rank. To check intent, just Google the keyword and look at what's actually ranking."

Ahrefs returns per-keyword `intents` flags directly from `mcp__ahrefs__keywords-explorer-overview` (include `intents` in `select`). Use them as the primary signal — higher quality than re-deriving from URL patterns.

### Primary signal — Ahrefs `intents` flags

| Intent value | Action |
|---|---|
| `informational` (alone or with `commercial`) | **Accept** (we publish blog posts; informational is publish-as-blog territory) |
| `commercial` (alone or with `informational`) | **Accept** (blog posts compete on "best/vs/review" SERPs) |
| `transactional` (dominant) | **Reject** reason `serp_is_transactional` |
| `navigational` (only intent) | **Reject** reason `serp_is_navigational` (single-brand SERP — usually not worth targeting) |
| empty / mixed-without-clear-dominant | fall through to SERP-grounded fallback |

### Fallback signal — SERP-grounded URL/title heuristic

When the `intents` flags are empty, equally split, or disagree with brand fit, classify the SERP top-10 (from `mcp__ahrefs__serp-overview`) by URL pattern + title heuristics. Demoted to tie-breaker.

| Class | URL/title signals | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `informational` | `/blog/`, `/learn/`, `/how-to/`; how/what/why/guide titles | **Accept** |
| `commercial-investigation` | `/best/`, `/vs/`, `/review/`; "best X for Y", "X vs Y" | **Accept** |
| `transactional` | `/products/`, `/shop/`, `/pricing/`; e-commerce platforms; price in snippet | **Reject** |
| `tool-led` | `/tools/`, `/calculator/`, `/generator/`; "free X tool" titles | **Route to tool-opportunities** (not blog queue) |
| `hybrid` | mixed top 10 (e.g. 4 blog + 4 product + 2 tool) | **Accept** if blog or commercial-investigation is plurality |

### Tool-led detection (independent gate, not in Ahrefs `intents`)

`tool-led` is **not** an Ahrefs intent label. Run the URL/title heuristic separately as a routing gate:
- Tool keywords are AI-Overview-immune (per the keyword-research method)
- But a *blog post* on a tool keyword loses to the *tools* that rank — the brand needs the tool, not a blog about the tool
- Layer 5 routes these to `tool-opportunities.csv` for offline triage

## D — Difficulty (KD + DR + weak-link check)

> "There's no way a single number can capture the true difficulty of ranking in an algorithm Google has spent billions perfecting. That's why you need to dig deeper into a page's metrics."

Difficulty (KD) alone is a one-number summary; the method's argument is to also check the link graph of the actual top-10 pages. Three signals:

1. **`difficulty`** — Ahrefs Keyword Difficulty (KD, 0-100) from `keywords-explorer-overview`. Captured but not the gate.
2. **`dr_top10_median`** — median Domain Rating of the top 10 ranking pages (from `serp-overview` / `batch-analysis`). A real proxy for "how authoritative are the pages I'd need to outrank."
3. **`weak_link_count`** — count of top-10 results with `DR < (brand_DR + 5)`. These are pages the brand could realistically displace.

Gate (Ahrefs DR-native):
- **Accept** if `dr_top10_median ≤ brand_DR + 15` (within striking distance)
- **Accept** if `weak_link_count ≥ 2` (at least two displaceable pages — a foothold strategy)
- **Reject** otherwise → reason `dr_gap_too_wide`

> **Reminder**: brand DR comes from `mcp__ahrefs__site-explorer-domain-rating`; cache it as `cache/brand-dr.json`. Don't reuse a stale `cache/brand-as.json` (Semrush Authority Score) — it's a different metric on a different scale and will silently mis-gate.

## Calibration

If the gate's behavior drifts (everything passes or everything fails), the threshold is wrong. Tune in this order:

1. **Everything passes** — gates too lenient. Raise floors:
   - brand_fit ≥ 5 (was 4)
   - product_fit ≥ 4 (was 3)
   - DR-gap to `brand_DR + 10` (was +15)
   - KD ≤ 60 (was 70)

2. **Nothing passes** — gates too tight OR pool is genuinely poor.
   - Look at the top FAIL reasons:
     - `dr_gap_too_wide` dominant → brand DR may be too low for current ambition. Relax to `brand_DR + 20` once and re-run.
     - `serp_is_transactional` dominant → Layer 1's seed/modifier mix is producing commerce-leaning candidates. Adjust modifiers (drop "buy", "shop" — keep "best", "vs", "review").
     - `brand_fit < 4` dominant → seeds are too generic. Tighten Layer 1a's prompt to require seeds tied to specific audience pain points.

Calibration logs go to `content-pipeline/0-keywords/cache/bid-calibration.log` so threshold drift over time is visible.

## What BID can't see

Mechanical filters miss judgment. Examples:

- **SERP intent is hybrid in a tricky way.** Top 10 has 4 blogs and 4 products; the intent classifier (Ahrefs `intents` or URL fallback) picks "commercial+informational" but user behavior is overwhelmingly transactional. Layer 4's redteam catches this with question (a) — "why might the SERP-intent classification be wrong?"
- **DR-gap is wide but the top pages are stale.** A 5-year-old listicle with high DR is beatable by a fresh, deeper article even if the metrics suggest otherwise. Layer 4's redteam catches this with question (c) — "is the difficulty assessment hiding a weak-link advantage?"
- **Brand_fit is high but the article won't produce revenue.** Vanity-rank trap. Layer 4 question (d) — "is the business potential overstated — does writing this actually produce revenue / users / brand mentions?"

BID is necessary but not sufficient. Layer 4 is where judgment kicks in.
